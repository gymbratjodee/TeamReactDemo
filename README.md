# TeamReactDemo

*** Class based component (when we want state) vs functional (no state - takes in props and returns static jsx)
*** set  initial state in component constructor
*** when state change the component and all its children instantly re-render
*** when importing custom file give relative path, when library just give library name
*** Try to limit callbacks and use Redux instead, but can use for simple parent child communication
*** In React state has applied locally to specific component, when we get into Redux state will be applicable to entire application
